# H1 Data Scientist Learning Journey
A day in my life as a **data science student.**
1. Woke up and took a bath.
2. Dressed up comfortably then ate. 
3. Opened my laptop and made a to-do list for the day. 
4. Started executing the tasks. 
5. Electricity went out, took a *nap.*
6. Electricity came back, then opened my pc and continued with my to-do tasks.

[^1]: The end...
